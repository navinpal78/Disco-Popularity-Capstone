<summary><b>The project explores how musical attributes affect popularity using machine learning</b></summary>

It provides insights into the relationships between song attributes and their success. Using these insights, Musicians, Musical Directors, Music Distributors, and Streaming Platforms can decide what makes good music for Listeners and produce and stream music accordingly.

For this Capstone project, I narrowed it down to Disco music and found the dataset on Kaggle.

<b>Trials and Triumphs</b>
Cleaning up the data and coding to ensure that the data made sense was difficult initially. Especially when errors are related to the columns' data and used in various training and modeling.

What you'd change
1.  Reading & understanding the data before even processing the dataset
2.  Plan the process better based on the dataset understanding.
3.  Explore more tool and libraries available to help with designing a better outcome for the ML training.
